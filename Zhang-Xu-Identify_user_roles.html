As a version control and source code management system, it also assembles many other features like watch, issue comment and commit comment etc. These features enable programmers to better collaborate and improve the communication. As there are various types of behaviors for every Github user, it would be interesting to see if the users can be clustered into different groups while each group has some special traits that distinguish from others. To achieve this, I proposed that there might be some different user types based on the user behavior. As users on Github have quite different backgrounds, level of skills and behavior preferences, users could have roles like contributors(make major contributions to the repositories), issue fixers(find and fix issues in the project), inactive users(not frequently use Github), watchers(mainly user github as a source of code and do not make any contributions).\n\nWith this motivation of identify user roles and its composition of Github, the paper of \"Identifying user behavior in online social networks\"[1] is chosen as the main reference of my research. In this paper, the authors chose youtube users and construct features of the users using both individual attributes and social features. They used these features and cluster youtube users into 5 main groups and define the role of each group. They also chose K-means as the clustering algorithm and Beta-CV to determine the number of K. The methods of this paper would be adopted in my own research to cluster users of Github.\n\nUnlike the literature I chose, Github users have so many different individual attributes that could be scrached from the user behaviors. For example, in the literature, there are only 5 individual attributes: Uploads, Watches, Channel views, Join date and Age. However, on Github, there are so many more types of behavior rather than just uploads and views. As a collaborative software developing platform, Github has many important features like fork, push, pull request, issue comment etc. Therefore, instead of choosing both social attributes and individual attributes, I chose to use the number of different type of behavior a user performed in a given time period to define user features. \n\nStarting from above assumptions and methods, in this research, I chose to use the data from githubArchive, which keeps the record of every event happend on Github since 2/12/2011. The data of Jan 2017 is used in this project and the number of each type of behavior performmed by each user are extracted from these raw data. Details of the data pre-pocessing can be found in the file DataExtraction.html\n\nThe main goals of this research are:\n\n1. Identify different users based on the user behavior.\n\n2. Explore features of each group's users, discover the behavior pattern of each cluster of users.\n\n3. Calculate the composition of users'groups on Github based on clustering results. Analyze the roles of these groups and their composition.","commandVersion":0,"state":"finished","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":1493059720666,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"a user","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"nuid":"a290f0a2-f948-4096-9c5d-6e14cf01e800"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":2068514224140243,"guid":"fdbcdbc3-6ba9-4ac7-9729-7aab0255532a","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":2.625,"command":"%md\n1.

Analysis of users'roles on github based on user behaviors\n======\nThis research is aimed at identify different users and their composition. The data is the number of different event that a Github user performed in Jan 2017. The main methods employed is the k-means model. The reason of choosing k-means is that it is a easy understanding, efficient and scalable clustering algorithm. And it has good results as long as the parameters are set correctly. In addition, the K-means||, which is the scalable version of k-means++ is adopted.

In [2] and [3] the authors suggest that this question can be answered by examining the variation of two metrics: the intracluster distance (average distance between each cluster point and its centroid) and the intercluster distance (average distance between centroids), both characterized by their Coefficient of Variation (CV). The goal is to minimize intracluster CV while maximizing the intercluster CV. **The ratio between the intracluster CV and the intercluster CV**,denoted by β CV , can help us select the value of K. Varying the number of clusters generates different values for β CV . The best indication for K would be when β CV becomes relatively stable [2, 3].

we look at the value of WSSSE of each number of K, it can be seen that the WSSSE value continues to decrease as the number of K goes up. However, the decresing rate is getting slower as k increase. It is known that the \"perfect\" situation is the number of K= the number of points. Therefore, the incresing of k must result in the decreasing of WSSSE. Thus, only from the WSSSE value, it is not enough to determine the appropriate k for clustering.\n\nThen we need to use Beta-cv. As I mentioned, the best indication for K would be when β-CV becomes relatively stable. From above figure, it is clear that the β-CV becomes stable at k=6. Combined with the figure of WSSSE, when k=6, the value of WSSSE is also relatively small. \n\n**Thus, with the sign of becoming stable at k=6 and relatively small value of WSSSE, *k=6* should be the best number of k for the clustering.**","commandVersion":0,"state":"finished","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"a user","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"nuid":"4e0f6a39-a87a-48bd-8457-3fca92e31706"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":3126516309257210,"guid":"1905271f-9300-425b-83d1-7c5efa5eb5f3","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":4.227143466472626,"command":"%md\n3.

From above figure, the users of github are divided into following 4 groups\n\nG0- Inactive users: This group of users are inactive and have very low values in all of the events. This kind of users have formed the major part of the Github users. There are over 82% of users that are inactive. This means that unlike other social network, the majority part of Github users do not frequently use it. A reasonalable answer is that github is such a technical website that most people can't really comfortably make use of the resources of github and quit. \n\nG1 & G2 & G5- Common users: These three groups share very similar patterns but with different values. Among these three, G1 has the highest values, then G2 and the lowest one is G5. However, if we look at the number of users in these three groups, it's acctually in the reverse order. G5 owns %14 of the users, G2 %3 and G1 only  0.5 %. These three groups form the major part of active users on Github. And with the use frequency increasing, the number of users decreased gradually.\n\nG3- Popular repository administrator: This group is very unique as G3 have high values in push, pullRequest, pullRequestComment, IssueComment, issue and Delete. High value in push means they are very active. Futhermore, high values in pullRequestComment, Issue, IssueComment demonstrate that they receive and reply to many issue and pullrequest. Only those users that have administration to some very popular and well-known repositories would have so many issues and pull requests to deal with. Compared to other groups, G3 also have extremely high value of Delete, which again confirmed their identity as repository administrators.\n\nG4- Enthusiastic contributors: This group have the highest value of push. Nonetheless, they have relatively low value in other events. Thus, they are very active in pushing commits but do not have many interests in communicating with others, post issues and make comments.\n\nAlthough G3 and G4 are very unique and make a lot of contributions to Github, they are only a very small part of Github users (In total about 0.2%). 99% of the users are inactive users and common users. In summary, Github have a substantial number of contributors (18%) while most of the users are inactive. These active users are the major force of the thriving of Github.

Conclusions\n===\nIn this report, the data of the numeber of events that performed by the Github users in January 2017 is extracted from Github Archive. The data is then feed into K-means model. Beta-CV and WSSSE are adpted to determine the number of K and then 6 is decided to be the optimal number of K. After clustering the users into 6 groups, the attributes of each cluster and clusters' composition are analyzed.\n\nIt is shown that the majority of Github users are inactive users and there are about 18% active users. Among the active users, there is a very tiny part that make great contribution to the repositories' management and growth. Identifying the user behavior has the potential to improve the user experience and accelerate the growth of the community. It also provide information for the customized recommendation system.\n","commandVersion":0,"state":"finished","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"a user","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"nuid":"c4b92755-6350-4a8a-b157-bc0cdeb41057"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":3537815890257456,"guid":"2b06a38d-e3d2-45b0-8bcc-baa6ff712420","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":9.33203125,"command":"%md\nReferences\n===\n[1] Maia, Marcelo, Jussara Almeida, and Virgílio Almeida. \"Identifying user behavior in online social networks.\" Proceedings of the 1st workshop on Social network systems.
